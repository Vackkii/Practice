			Parvati Hill is a hillock in Pune, India. The hillock rises to 2,100 feet (640 m) above sea level. Atop the hillock is the Parvati Temple, one of the most scenic locations in Pune. The temple is the oldest heritage structure in Pune and was built during the rule of the Peshwa dynasty. For visitors, Parvati hill is also an observation point that offers a panoramic view of Pune. It is the second highest point in Pune (after Vetal Hill). The hill has 108 steps (considered a holy number in Hinduism) leading to the top of the hill where the temple is situated. The hill was owned by the Patil named Taware. Peshwa purchased the hill to build a temple of Shiva. The Devi temple was believed to be of Taware's kulswami whose angara was able to cure a leg ailment of Kashibai, mother of Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao. Thereafter, the Peshwa built a temple complex there.
